# Line search and step size settings

The step size dictates how far one traverses along a local descent direction.
More specifically, the step size $gamma_t$ is used at each iteration to determine
how much the next iterate moves towards the new vertex:  
```math
x_{t+1} = x_t - \gamma_t (x_t - v_t).
```
  
``\gamma_t = 1`` implies that the next iterate is exactly the vertex,
a zero $\gamma_t$ implies that the iterate is not moving.  

The following are step size selection rules for Frank Wolfe algorithms.
Some methodologies (e.g. `FixedStep` and `Agnostic`) depend only on the iteration number and induce series $\gamma_t$
that are independent of the problem data,
while others (e.g. `GoldenSearch` and `Adaptive`) change according
to local information about the function; the adaptive methods
often require extra function and/or gradient computations. The
typical options for convex optimization are `Agnostic` or `Adaptive`.  

All step size computation strategies are subtypes of [`FrankWolfe.LineSearchMethod`](@ref).
The key method they have to implement is [`FrankWolfe.perform_line_search`](@ref)
which is called at every iteration to compute the step size gamma.
